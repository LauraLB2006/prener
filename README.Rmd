# prener <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

The goal of `prener` is to document functions that I use frequently in my own research and teaching.

## Installation

`prener` is not available from CRAN (and never will be!). You can install `prener` from [Github](https://github.com/chris-prener/prener) with `devtools`:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chris-prener/prener")
```

## Useage
### Plotting
`prener` includes a number of functions that I use in conjunction with `ggplot2`. One issue I address is that `ggsave()` does not accept measurements for `width` and `height` in points, but Keynote lays slides out using points as the unit of measurement. The `cp_points()` function will convert points to inches, centimeters, or millimeters (the units used by `ggsave()`).

```{r}
prener::cp_points(200, units = "in")
prener::cp_points(200, units = "cm")
prener::cp_points(200, units = "mm")
```

The [Keynote templates](https://github.com/chris-prener/sequoia_templates) that I use for teaching and presentations have three standard sizes that I create plots for - small (960 x 540 points), medium (960 x 630 points), and large (1024 by 768 points). The `cp_plotSave()` function will export `ggplot2` plots at these dimensions. By default, these are done at 300 dots per inch but that can also be adjusted:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_histogram()

prener::cp_plotSave("hwy.png", p, preset = "sm")
prener::cp_plotSave("hwy.png", p, preset = "med")
prener::cp_plotSave("hwy.png", p, preset = "lg", dpi = 500)
```

### Tables
`prener` has a function, modeled on the [`frequencies` package](https://github.com/DataInsightPartners/frequencies), for creating tidy frequency tables, primarily for discrete variables. The main differences between the original function `freq_vect()` and my implementation is that I (1) make the inclusion of missing data optional and (2) make the number of significant digits displayed explicit and customizeable.

```{r}
tableData <- data.frame(
    id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
    nhoodStr = c("Patch", "Bevo Mill", "Bevo Mill", "Lindenwood Park", "Carondelet" , "Shaw"),
    visit = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, NA),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )

prener::cp_tidyTable(tableData$nhoodStr)

prener::cp_tidyTable(tableData$visit, round = 3)

prener::cp_tidyTable(tableData$visit, round = 2, missRow = FALSE)
```

The package also provides a function for converting tidy tables into LaTeX-formatted frequency tables. The function can either create a full LaTeX document (`type = "doc"`), only the LaTeX table (`type = "table"`), or only the applicable rows with values (`type = "row"`). The last option can be used for creating a LaTeX table with multiple sections for different discrete variables.

```{r}
tableData <- data.frame(
    id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
    nhoodStr = c("Patch", "Bevo Mill", "Bevo Mill", "Lindenwood Park", "Carondelet" , "Shaw"),
    visit = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, NA),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )

prener::cp_texTable(tableData, "visit", type = "table", title = "Neighborhoods Visited")
```

The output is modeled on the [`stargazer` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/):

![](man/figures/texTableExample.png)

Both the [`multirow`](https://ctan.org/pkg/multirow) and [`hhline`](https://ctan.org/pkg/hhline) packages must be loaded in the preamble of your LaTeX document. The `type = "doc"` output will include these, but if you are adding a table to a pre-existing document, be sure to add them!

### Statistics
`prener` includes a helper function for calculating p-values under the t-distribution:

```{r}
prener::cp_probt(3.6308, df = 72)
```
