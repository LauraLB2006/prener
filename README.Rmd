# prener <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

The goal of `prener` is to document functions that I use frequently in my own research and teaching.

## Installation

`prener` is not available from CRAN (and never will be!). You can install `prener` from [Github](https://github.com/chris-prener/prener) with `devtools`:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chris-prener/prener")
```

## Useage
### Plotting
`prener` includes a number of functions that I use in conjunction with `ggplot2`. One issue I address is that `ggsave()` does not accept measurements for `width` and `height` in points, but Keynote lays slides out using points as the unit of measurement. The `cp_points()` function will convert points to inches, centimeters, or millimeters (the units used by `ggsave()`).

```{r}
prener::cp_points(200, units = "in")
prener::cp_points(200, units = "cm")
prener::cp_points(200, units = "mm")
```

The [Keynote templates](https://github.com/chris-prener/sequoia_templates) that I use for teaching and presentations have three standard sizes that I create plots for - small (960 x 540 points), medium (960 x 630 points), and large (1024 by 768 points). The `cp_plotSave()` function will export `ggplot2` plots at these dimensions. By default, these are done at 300 dots per inch but that can also be adjusted:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_histogram()

prener::cp_plotSave("hwy.png", p, preset = "sm")
prener::cp_plotSave("hwy.png", p, preset = "med")
prener::cp_plotSave("hwy.png", p, preset = "lg", dpi = 500)
```
