[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/prener)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=prener)

The goal of `prener` is to document functions that I use frequently in my own research and teaching.

## Installation

`prener` is not available from CRAN (and likely never will be!). You can install `prener` from [Github](https://github.com/chris-prener/prener) with `devtools`:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chris-prener/prener")
```

## Useage
### Plotting
`prener` includes a number of functions that I use in conjunction with `ggplot2`, including a function (`cp_points()`) for converting measurements from points to inches, centimeters, and millimeters and a function (`cp_plotSave()`) for standardized export options.

### Tables
The package also includes functionality

### Statistics
`prener` includes a helper function for calculating p-values under the t-distribution:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
> cp_probt(3.6308, df = 72)
[1] 0.0005254992
```
